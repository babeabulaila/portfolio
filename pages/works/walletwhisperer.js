          This project was made during the very first Flow Hackathon! This
          application helps solve the problems many crypto native and non-crypto
          native users experience when trying to make an offer on another piece
          of art in another personâ€™s collection that belongs to a wallet that
          has little or no way to communicate them especially when no socials
          are linked. This allows people to be able to communicate with other
          wallets while also incentivizing others to check their inbox as they
          receive coins for weekly logins that can be used to share some of
          their collection or post an advertisement on the home page.
        </P>
